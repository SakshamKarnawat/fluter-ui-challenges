# Morse Code Learning - Flutter UI Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the Morse Code Learning Flutter mobile app project! This project is a UI implementation inspired by the design available on Dribbble, created by [Purrweb UI/UX Agency](https://dribbble.com/purrwebui). The goal of this project is to bring the design to life and create an interactive and user-friendly Morse code learning experience. Please note that the UI/UX design on Dribbble is not the creation or property of the developer(s) of this app.

## Design Inspiration

The design for this app was inspired by [this Dribbble design](https://dribbble.com/shots/22515146-A-Morse-Code-Learning-Mobile-iOS-App), which serves as the visual foundation for my Flutter UI implementation. I acknowledge and appreciate the creative work done by Purrweb UI/UX Agency in crafting this visually appealing design.

## Notes

- The icons used in the app are not the same as the one used in the design inspiration. I have instead used icons from various free sources.

- To ensure the availability of design inspiration, I have also archived the Dribbble design [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230910183434/https://dribbble.com/shots/22515146-A-Morse-Code-Learning-Mobile-iOS-App) on archive.org. This ensures that the design remains accessible even if the original Dribbble link becomes unavailable.

## Screenshots

I have included screenshots of the app's user interface in the `assets\design` folder. These screenshots faithfully represent the visual design and layout inspired by the Dribbble design. The background image used in the app is also included in the `assets\images` folder.
